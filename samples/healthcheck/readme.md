## Health check

You may want to ensure that kubernetes uses custom criteria to determine if a container is healthy or not.
- Readiness probe: Check if ia container is ready to serve requests
- Liveness probe: check is a container is healthy. 

You can run a http call or run a command inside a container to check health
